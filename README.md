LeafNet: a mobile application that recognizes trees

This is a repository for showcasing our works and collaborations of software
development course only. It's not meant for commercial purpose (yet).

*Update: If you are wondering why the name of this repository is not related to
its goal, then read the following section:*

## DISCLAIMER

The original project goal has been abandoned and all the documents in side this
repository are unrelated whatsoever to the starting goal (Building a **LeafNet**
application).

This repository is now just a container for our UML diagrams drafted for a
software development course.

Thus, all the documents are not reflecting our first vision anymore.
We are sorry that we cannot keep up with your expectation.
